#Description

This is my first portfolio page which includes all of my projects. I have catagorized my projects from vanilla Javascript to React.js to jQuery, and WordPress focused sites. This site was built using HTML, SASS, CSS, and JavaScript along with Particles.js for tasteful design on the header introducing myself. The site was built using the mobile first approach and is fully responsive for mobile or tablet use. I might redo my portfolio page using BootStrap in the future as well.
